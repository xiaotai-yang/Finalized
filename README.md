## Introduction

The Neural Quantum State (NQS) is a variational ansatz for representing the wave function of quantum systems. It leverages the power of neural networks to approximate the quantum wave function and solve the Schr√∂dinger equation using variational methods. However, different projection basis affects the performance of the NQS significantly. Here we show that we can quantify this difficulty with conditional mutual information.

## 1D Hamiltonian 

- H_type: "ES" or "cluster" which means entanglement swapping state or a cluster state.

## 2D Hamiltonian

- Only graph state now so no variable here

# 1D & 2D autoregressive model
- numsamples: The batch size of each training
- testing_sample: The batch size for final evaluation of the ground state energy after the training. 
- dmrg (only for 1D): Whether to use dmrg ground truth to get the phases of the quantum state.
## Recurrent neural network (RNN)
- numunits: Hidden layer width of the RNN.
## Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV)
- RWKV_emb: THe size of the embedding input
- RWKV_hidden: The hidden layer length of the RWKV
- RWKV_layer: How many layer of RWKV we apply
- RWKV_ff: The final feedforward network size in each RWKV layer
## Transformer Quantum state (TQS)
- TQS_layer: How many layer of Transformer we apply
- TQS_units : Hidden layer width (QKV) for the transformer
- TQS_ff: The final feedforward network size in each layer
- TQS_head: The number of head in multihead attenetion.

# Restriced Boltzmann Machine
There is only two models and no submodule so I just wrote them in two individual files. The variables are:
- alpha: The width of the hidden layer
- numsamples: The batch size of each training
