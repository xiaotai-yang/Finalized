## Introduction

The Neural Quantum State (NQS) is a variational ansatz for representing the wave function of quantum systems. It leverages the power of neural networks, particularly Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) or more advanced architectures, to approximate the quantum wave function and solve the Schr√∂dinger equation using variational methods.

In this project, we use **Variational Monte Carlo (VMC)** to optimize the parameters of a neural network to minimize the energy of the quantum system.
